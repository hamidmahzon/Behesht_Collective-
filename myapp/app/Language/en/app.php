    'meta_description'    => 'Behesht Collective is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to promoting human rights and supporting the Afghan LGBT community. The organization was founded in 2015 by a group of activists who were concerned about the lack of support for marginalized communities in Afghanistan. The Behesht Collective believes that every individual has the right to live their life free from discrimination and persecution. They work tirelessly to raise awareness about human rights issues in Afghanistan and advocate for change at both the local and international levels. One of the key areas of focus for Behesht Collective is supporting the Afghan LGBT community. This community faces significant challenges in Afghanistan, where homosexuality is illegal and carries severe penalties, including imprisonment and even death. Despite these challenges, Behesht Collective remains committed to supporting the Afghan LGBT community. They provide a range of services, including counseling, legal assistance, and advocacy. They also work to raise awareness about LGBT issues in Afghanistan through public events, media campaigns, and other initiatives. Overall, Behesht Collective is an inspiring example of an organization that is dedicated to promoting human rights and supporting marginalized communities. Their work is essential in creating a more just and equitable society in Afghanistan, where all individuals can live their lives free from discrimination and persecution.',
